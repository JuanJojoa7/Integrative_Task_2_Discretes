# Integrative_Task_2_Discretes

The project consists of developing a movie recommendation system using graph algorithms for the company MEGA-MOVIES. The main objective is to offer users personalized suggestions based on their preferences and the interactions of other users. The system will allow you to search for movies by different criteria, generate automatic recommendations and offer an intuitive graphical interface to explore and discover movies. The approach is based on two versions of the graph, using matrix-based representations and adjacency lists, to find similar movies and optimize recommendations. The project seeks to facilitate the user experience by finding movies that fit their tastes and preferences.
